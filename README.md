# library Management System

A library management system is a software application that helps librarians and users to manage, maintain, and monitor the library resources. A library management system typically has the following features:

- **User login**: The system allows users and administrators to log in with their credentials and access different functions according to their roles.
- **Book management**: The system enables librarians to add, edit, delete, and view books in the library database. Users can also search for books by various criteria, such as title, author, genre, etc.
- **Book lending**: The system facilitates the process of issuing and returning books to and from users. It records the details of each transaction, such as user ID, book ID, issue date, return date, etc. It also calculates the fines for overdue books and sends reminders to users.
- **Report generation**: The system can generate various reports and statistics on the library operations, such as the number of books, users, transactions, fines, etc. It can also display the most popular books, genres, authors, etc.

There are many examples of library management systems done in Java. They use different Java libraries and frameworks, such as Swing, AWT, JDBC, SQLite, etc. to create the user interface, database connection, and business logic of the system.
